# üöó Car Automation System ‚Äì IoT Lab Hackathon Project

A smart car automation prototype built using Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor, and temperature sensor. This system enhances vehicle safety by detecting obstacles and monitoring temperature, with immediate alerts through a buzzer and autonomous motion adjustments.

## üìò Project Overview

The goal of this project is to integrate key IoT components in a small-scale car system to:
- Avoid obstacles using an **ultrasonic sensor**
- Monitor temperature conditions using a **temperature sensor**
- Alert users via a **buzzer**
- Control direction using **DC motors**

Developed as part of the **IoT Lab Hackathon** under the guidance of **Prof. Nithya S.**, this project is a demonstration of real-time embedded systems in automation and safety.

## üß† Core Components

### Sensors
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: For obstacle detection and distance measurement
- **Temperature Sensor**: To monitor ambient or component temperature

### Actuator
- **Buzzer**: To provide sound alerts in critical situations (e.g., object too close)

### Controller
- **Arduino UNO**: The microcontroller used to interface sensors and control the car

## üì¶ Features

- Automatic forward movement unless obstacle detected
- Directional decision-making based on obstacle position
- Sound-based alerts for safety
- Custom control logic using real-time sensor feedback
- Basic self-navigation logic implemented in Arduino

## üíª Code Structure

Main features:
- Distance measured using `pulseIn()` with ultrasonic sensor
- Threshold-based obstacle logic
- Conditional turning and movement
- Real-time buzzer alerts

Code snippet:
```cpp
if (distance < obstacleThreshold) {
  stopCar();
  if (checkObstacleOnRight()) {
    goBackward();
    turnLeft();
  } else {
    turnRight();
  }
} else {
  moveForward();
}
```
Full Arduino code is provided in the repository.
